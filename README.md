# GFH Room tracker 
> React + Redux + Redux-Saga + Socket.IO + MongoDB

## Case 

GFH its a busy roadhouse that needs to keep track of their housekeeping (HK) services status. A day consists of  different services to about 15 rooms. When a costumer comes back to their room or check in for a new one, administration call their HK team if XYZ rooms are available.

## Solution 

Implementing the lastest version of `React Boilerplate` to learn the new addition `Hooks` in `React 16.8`. I developed a simple dashboard to keeps track of their HK services. For real time status `Socket.IO` was used. App keeps track dates for room items as well, allows edition and service history.
